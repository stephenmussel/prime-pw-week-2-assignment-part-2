// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// For questions 1-3, each code block is syntactically and logically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening.
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.
// Describe the code as it would be run, and make sure you give us the console.log's value at the end.
// (Don't just say 'we console log the variable' -- instead say something like 'we console log 'yes'')


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/


// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We make a variable called name and set it to Dane as a string
// We check if name is the same data type and value as Mary
// Dane isn't equal to Mary
// Then we console.log 'How do you do?'

//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';

if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');
}

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We make a variable called secret with no value
// We make a variable called code and set it to 123 as a number
// We check if code is the same data type and value as 123. 123 is equal to 123.
// Then secret variable is set to super as a string
// Then code is set to the value of code multiplied by 2. Code is set to 426 as a number
// We console.log 'super'

//CODE
/*
let secret;

let code = 123;

  secret = 'super';
  code = code * 2;
}

// 3. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We make a variable called isStudent and set it to true as a boolean
// We make a variable called age and set it to 34 as a number
// We make a variable called zip and set it to 55407 as a number
// We check if isStudent is the same data type and value as true and if zip is greater than 8000
// isStudent is equal to true but zip is not greater than 8000
// Then we check if isStudent is the same data type and value as true or if age is less than 30
// isStudent is not equal to false and age is not less than 30
// Then we check if isStudent is the same data type and value as true
// isStudent is equal to true
// We console.log 'Welcome to Prime!'

//CODE
/*
let isStudent = true;
let age = 34;
let zip = 55407;

if (isStudent === true && zip > 80000 ) {
  console.log(`You're a student on the West Coast!`);

// REVERSE
// Now, for questions 4-6, we'll give you a description and some code.
// Some of the code will NOT match the description.
// Comment above the problem code, and describe a potential solution.
// Look closely -- things are logically incorrect or missing and wrong in the code!

// EXAMPLE
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2.
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment.
// Should be number++.
number--;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/



//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and
// colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true
// -- it is, so we set colorOne and colorTwo to 'purple'

/*

// FIX - colorOne should be set to blue as a string and colorTwo should be set to red as a string
// FIX (after assignment submission) also assign colorTwo = 'purple';
let colorOne = 'red';
let colorTwo = 'blue';
let mix = true;

if (mix === true) {
  colorOne = 'purple';
}
*/

//5. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'

/*
let temp = 40;
const time = 4;

// FIX - logical operator should be and (&&) not or (||)
if (temp > 39 || time >= 4) {
  console.log('throw away the food!');
}
*/

//6. We start with two variables -- age is set to 21 and minAge is set to 21.
// We check if age is greater than or equal to minAge
// -- it is, so we console.log 'enter'.

/*
let age = 21;
const minAge = 21;

// FIX - conditions are swapped and age should be compared to miniAge. comparison operator should also be >=
// FIX (after assignment submission) string in line 178 should read 'enter' and assuming string in line 180 should read 'no entry'
